              <p>Contributing to open source for the first time can be a little scary and overwhelming. <a href='https://anitab.org/' >AnitaB.org</a> Open Source is here to help you get started on learning how to contribute to open source.</p>
              <p> <a href='https://anitab.org/'>AnitaB.org</a> Open Source has a variety of open source projects on GitHub <a href='https://github.com/anitab-org'>(https://github.com/anitab-org)</a> for everyone to contribute. If you have never contributed to an open source project, check out each repository and try out 'First Timers Only' issues.</p>
              <p>We encourage contributions of ALL kinds (content, design, coding, documentation, testing, etc) from community members. Each member has the opportunity to gain global collaboration experience working on projects with social impact and improve hard & soft skills while participating as a volunteer, mentor, writer, coder, designer, app tester, and more!</p>
              <p>
              Here are some list of contributions to any of the AnitaB.org Open Source projects, for example: create GitHub issues regarding an open source project, work on/ debug a project issue, update project documentation, create organization content, create/test a pull request, produce mockups for websites/ applications/ organization promotional material, research on UI/UX improvements and accessibilty features, etc.

        <p>Testing is one of the most important steps in the development of anything. If you are a good observer and want to test an app, website, or a solution to some issues then you must go for it.</p>
        <p> Any project that's designed to run on multiple platforms can have all sorts of portability problems. When a release approaches and a beta or release candidate is published, the project leader hopes that it will be tested by many different people on many different platforms. You can be one of those people and help ensure that the package works on your platform.</p>

        <p>A good contribution takes time as you have to do a lot of research to find out what is the best for you. Similarly, the field of open source development needs a lot of research, feedback, and study to improve the platform and make it popular among the people.</p>
        <p>If you like to study and observe what changes can be made for improving the platform then you can contribute under Outreach and research section.<br/>You can also help others with their research and doubts related to the platform.</p>

        <p>The best way to help build the community is by helping others. Answering a question, especially from someone who is just getting his feet wet, is crucial to helping the project grow and thrive. </p>
        <p>Managing skills are an important skill when you are working under an organization with a large number of community members. It also requires leadership skills and communication skills.<br/> If you think you are a good manager you can work under the project management team and contribute there.</p>
