We have incredible Systers (Robin Jeffries, Jen Redman, Terri Oda, Leslie Hawthorn, Avni Khatri, and the list goes on!) that paved the way and introduced Systers to open source projects, communities, and technologies. Systers has been involved with open source in various ways, introducing Open Source Day at Grace Hopper Celebration in 2010 at Atlanta, GA (At the time, it was called Codethon for Humanity with only one open source project, Sahana Eden)."
